# NutriBuddy

A personalized health and fitness recommendation system that integrates hybrid recommender systems with natural language processing capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Modern users demand personalized health and fitness recommendations tailored to their unique preferences, dietary restrictions, and health conditions. Current recommendation systems struggle with:
- Effectively integrating diverse user inputs, such as health conditions and preferences
- Providing seamless interaction where users can explain their needs conversationally
- Generating meaningful, accurate dietary or exercise plans from complex datasets like blood reports

## Project Significance

This project addresses the growing demand for personalized health recommendations by:
- Simplifying user interactions through conversational AI
- Providing highly personalized meals and exercise plans using both structured data and unstructured input
- Empowering users to achieve better health outcomes with recommendations tailored to their physiological and dietary needs

## Key Features

1. Hybrid recommender system integrating:
   - Collaborative filtering
   - Content-based filtering
   - LLM capabilities

2. Natural language query support for interpreting user input

3. Personalized recommendations based on:
   - User health history
   - Activity levels
   - Preferences
   - Blood report metrics

4. Scalable and modular architecture using Docker
